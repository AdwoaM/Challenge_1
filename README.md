* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
 A major advantage of Plaid having a usage-based business model is the potential to grow alongside some of its earliest customers. Specifically, Plaid’s revenue is a function of its API usage. By extension, its revenue is also a function of the number of developers or users using Plaid’s API in some way. As a result, the more users an app or service has, the more API calls that company will send, and the more revenue that Plaid will generate from a specific customer. For example, Plaid’s ability to capture customers such as Venmo and Robinhood early in their rise, coupled with a usage-based business model has allowed Plaid to benefit from the growth of its customers. Here is how a former Plaid employee described Plaid’s early outlook on a usage-based model:

“The way we viewed our self-service product was, it's a way for us to capture as many lottery tickets as cheaply as possible … We don't know which early-stage company is going to get funding, which company has gotten into YC, or which companies are really going to break out and drive a lot of growth. But we do know we want those companies.”

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.)
Plaid uses secure cloud infrastructure technologies to enable quick and safe connection, the combination of AES-256 AND TLS help keep personal information sage end-to-end. Plaid’s API are continuously monitored by their info security team as well as security researchers who seek to regularly audit the API and security controls.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
[enter CNN] () Without Plaid, being a third party, whose technology links bank accounts to fintech apps like Robinhood, Coinbase, Venmo, start-ups would have had to hire their own engineers and create their own ways to sync with banks. For companies, Plaid offers a simple yet secure way to connect with customer’s financial data. Their API gives businesses the opportunity to easily access, manage and use the financial data of their customers allowing for a more congruent, effective and personalized experience. For Developers, it simplifies the process of working with financial data which allows them to build financial software and for consumers, Plaid offers a secure way to manage their finances, and security measures to protect user’s data.

Opportunities for Plaid [] (https://research.contrary.com/reports/plaid)
Plaid’s products have always relied on network effects. As Plaid incorporates more integrations across more products and types of financial data, that network effect will only expand. Plaid’s layer of abstraction is a valuable asset that has allowed them to expand into adjacent areas of financial services in recent years including turning credit card history and account transfers into a loan decision to assist mortgage companies.
The long-term thesis for Plaid revolves around the opportunity to reach non-fintech applications and companies. Plaid can broaden the scope to include any company that could benefit from integrating with a customer’s bank account. Plaid could help apps in sectors such as hospitality, travel, and shopping to better understand consumers’ spending and offer them personalized deals. Plaid CTO, Jean-Denis Greze spoke to the potential of reaching non-fintech companies in stating that:
“Our philosophy is to provide the building blocks, and then we’re often surprised by how developers can use those building blocks to do something clever. We don’t know what that will look like. But we know that we make it easier for consumers to get started, make it easier for developers to build products full of insights, and we make it easier even for non-fintechs to start to offer things like payments or loans.“

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
I believe that this service will exponentially increase the market share of Plaid thereby increasing their revenue. Being the first to step into this before its competitors do pave a way for securing Higher growth in revenue before its competitors step into this phase and potentially becoming the backbone of the open marking domain capturing both financial and non financial institutions.
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
 Ask Edwin Build API which provides a list of non-financial applications

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
This will easily help pave the way for Plaid to contribute to non financial institutions
